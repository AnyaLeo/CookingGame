# CookingGame
 Cooking game project to teach high school students game development in Unity.
 
 ## Progress so far: random recipe generator
 
 During our ideation session, someone came up with an idea of infinite recipe generation. So I figured, if we have a looot of ingredients, and each ingredient can be combined into a dish, we just have to record all the unique combinations of ingredients to give an illusion of infinite recipes.
 
 And to keep track of all the recipes, we give them a name!
