# CookingGame
 Cooking game project to teach high school students game development in Unity.
 
 # STUDENTS: How to download the project if you missed class
 1. Click on the green "Code" button somewhere in the right corner
 2. Click "Download ZIP". This will download the zipped folder containing our entire game project.
 3. Locate the folder on your computer.
 4. Unzip it (right-click on it and see if you can spot any "Extract to..." or "Extract All" options. You can also download and use 7-Zip for this task)
 5. Open Unity Hub (not Unity!)
 6. Click on the "Open" button in Unity Hub
 7. Find and select the folder that you just unzipped in step 4. 
 8. (Optional) If you don't have Unity 2020.3.29f1, your Unity will complain that the project versions don't match. You can download Unity 2020.3.29f1 (Unity Hub should give you a prompt for that), but if you have a *higher* version of Unity, you can just switch your project to that by changing its editor version in the list. 
 
 ## Progress so far: random recipe generator
 
 During our ideation session, someone came up with an idea of infinite recipe generation. So I figured, if we have a looot of ingredients, and each ingredient can be combined into a dish, we just have to record all the unique combinations of ingredients to give an illusion of infinite recipes.
 
 And to keep track of all the recipes, we give them a name!
